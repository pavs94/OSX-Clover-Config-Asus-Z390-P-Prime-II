# OSX Clover Config Asus Z390-P Prime II

My current config on which this works like a charm: 
- i5 9600k
- 16GB DDR4 3000Mhz Corsair RAM
- 500GB Kingston SSD
- 1 TB Seagate Barrcuda HDD
- Sapphire RX480 GPU

Clover version 5103 

```
Please use this at your own risk. I am not responsible for your devices being bricked. It worked for me. It may not work for you.
